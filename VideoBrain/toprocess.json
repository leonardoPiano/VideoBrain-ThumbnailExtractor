The design introduced a tone and colour scheme which was built upon with fast paced energetic lyrics which correspond with the tempo of the song\"\n\nPete Stride from The Lurkers described it as; \"a slightly deranged lyric video… and that’s just fine.”\n\nThis is the album version of ‘Shadow’ recorded by Stride/Esso/Wall/Moore\n\nhttp://godslonelymen.com\nwww.facebook.com/BeggarsArchive\n\n@beggarsarchive",

One of me on a bed, for which my poor hands had to spend 2 hours in make up, and another covered in spunk in the basement. A load of old bollocks really. Oh yeah, MTV banned this one too for being too, er...creepy. The kid being born out of the pod in the basement was an actor off Grange Hill. Apparently Donald Sutherland liked it. I liked MASH too.\n\n\nIOU LOVE\n\nYou are the atom that started life\nYou are the glue of the universe\nEvery thousand years I’ve learned to take a breath\nYou are cosmic and I love you\nThey brought down the stars\nAnd shined them because of you\nThey painted the sky in blue\n‘Cause you asked them to\nAnd all the rewards of life\nAre just simple truths\nYou are reasoning for sure\nOh I’ll never know the secrets of the world\nI’ll never know, I’ll never learn them now\n\nIOU love...\n\nI remember when you covered the earth in sleep\nThe ebb and flow and touch of your kiss\nThere can’t be a better way\nWith my last breath I will call your name\nOh I’ll never know the secrets of the world\nI’ll never know, I’ll never learn them now\n\nIOU love...",

Sounds like a perfectly reasonable music video to me.\n\n\nNEW YEAR\n\nGive me something I can live for\nGive me something to believe in\nFeed me saline, plasma life line\nSkinned by sunlight, I’m hiding inside\nI wanna reach out\nAnd I wanna stay\nHow can I lose\nIf I refuse to fail\n\nBroken pavements and bombed out buildings\nNothing left but mines for children\nRight side numb and the left side is useless\nOh my world you really thrill me\nI wanna reach out\nAnd I wanna stay\nHow can I lose\nIf I refuse to fail\n\nInto the new year",

        "description": "Candlelight\n\nThis was made in a basement in Spitalfields Market in East London and I still have no idea why? It could have been made anywhere for probably half the money but then that wouldn't have been quite as trendy I suppose. It was also very clever because they put strobes all over it which subsequently got it banned from MTV, the very channel they were making it for. Genius! MTV banned it because they said that when the strobes kicked in people watching it would be freaking out and having fits. We pleaded with MTV and told them that this was precisely the sort of fan we were trying to appeal to but they were having none of it. Are you perhaps having a fit now whist watching this? If so, write to YouTube not us.\n\nCANDLELIGHT\n\nSomething broke like an egg in my throat\nSomething stopped beating blood in my chest\nForever gone, you are with me when I miss you\nCandlelight give me time to get things right\n\nCan you slow down?\nCan you slow down now?\nSlow down, slow down\nCan you slow down now\nMy candlelight\n\nI was counting clouds in a clear blue empty sky\nI was skimming stones on a river the dam made dry\nIs it fair, you are here when I am long gone?\nOpen your eyes, close the door and take what’s yours\n\nCan you slow down?\nCan you slow down now?\nSlow down, slow down\nCan you slow down now\nMy candlelight\n\nWe die a lot and live a little",

        "description": "Taken from 1998s 'The Things We Make'\n\n88-92-96\n\nThis was our first video and we made it on a £2000 budget. Most of that money went on 16mm film stock and processing. It was filmed in two locations, up on the moors in Snake Pass and at Skegness or somewhere on the east coast. It was a hideous experience and to this day I have no idea why I even bothered turning up for it. Standing barefoot on the beach in winter until my feet felt like they were gonna fall off and sitting around in a freezing cold trench all day waiting for someone to fix a camera up or boss someone around was just the most thankless and idiotic way to spend a single day of your life. I could have been writing a song or watching telly, anything but that. Still I never had water thrown at my head like the other numpties. There was a girl sitting on the beach called 'catering' and she made us sandwiches with spread cheese and sand in. I wanted to kill everyone. hashtag: christianbale\n\nPeople tell me Emma Niblett is in it who later made records under the name Scout Niblett. I don't really know who she is and I never met her and have no idea why she is in it?\n\nI don't understand this video or why Chris is snogging that girl and to me it's just utter sixth form garbage that I wish I would have never taken part in. \n\n88-92-96\n\nI wish you could see what I can see\nI wish you could dream what I have to dream\n2 million lives killed by my own hand\n2 million lies have rolled across my tongue\n\nI'm just a white singer with no tone in my voice\nThings that I say, do you think i'm talking to you?\nWell I don't understand this thing that I do\nI still can't stand the sound of my only voice.\n\n\"But you do it so well\nYou do it so well\nYou do it so well...\"\n\nI really don't care\nStop talking at me",

Created in New York with Arthur Baker, John Robie and Jellybean Benitez (before their work with New Order) this was one of the first electro dance hits to highlight the street-scene happening in the New York boroughs. It has remained an influential track that's often sampled and all the original mixes were re-issued in 2011.",
